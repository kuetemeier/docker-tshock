## Motivation

**I don't wanted to reinvent the wheel with every new repository I create**,
so I use this template as a common starting point for my projects.

## Quick start

### Integrate it into your own repo

Create your Git repository (e.g. on GitHub) or with a simple `git init`.

Now let's add this repository as a remote:

    git remote add project-template git@github.com:kuetemeier/project-template.git

and fetch the master (or tag you like to fetch)

    git fetch project-template

now inlcude the template into your project

    git merge project-template/master

That's all. Now you have the template files in your repo and can edit and push
them to your new project repository.

### Customize the project template

1. **Choose a license for your project**
   If you're not sure which to pick choose one from [choosealicense.com](http://choosealicense.com/).
   We reccomend you to choose the Apache 2.0 license, but that's a decision you have to make.
2. **Put your licenses into the LICENSE files**
   There are two files in this template: `LICENSE` and `/doc/LICENSE`
3. **Edit the README.md and CONTRIBUTION.md files**
   Edit the `README.md` file to reflect your new project name, description and license. Replace all occurrences of `kuetemeier`, `Kuetemeier.NET`, and `project-template` in both files with your own project name and contact informations.
