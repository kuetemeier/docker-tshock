# Contributing to this project

**We are glad you want to contribute to this project!**

We utilize Github Issues for issue tracking and contributions. You can contribute in two ways:

Reporting an issue or making a feature request.
Adding features or fixing bugs yourself and contributing your code to this GitHub repository.

## Code of Conduct

The Code of Conduct explains the *bare minimum* behavior
expectations the Node Foundation requires of its contributors.
[Please read it before participating.](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

## Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

Licensing is very important to open source projects. It helps ensure the software continues to be available under the terms that the author desired.

This Project uses the [Apache 2.0 license](./LICENSE) to strike a balance between open contribution and allowing you to use the software however you would like to.

The license tells you what rights you have that are provided by the copyright holder. It is important that the contributor fully understands what rights they are licensing and agrees to them. Sometimes the copyright holder isn't the contributor, such as when the contributor is doing work for a company.

To make a good faith effort to ensure these criteria are met, this project requires an CLA for contributions. This agreement helps ensure you are aware of the terms of the license you are contributing your copyrighted works under, which helps to prevent the inclusion of works in the projects that the contributor does not hold the rights to share.

You can easily [sign the CLA](https://cla-assistant.io/kuetemeier/project-template) with your GitHub account.

## Code Contributions

We welcomes new contributors. This document will guide you through the contribution process.

### Step 1: Fork

Fork the project [on GitHub](https://github.com/kuetemeier/project-template) and check out your
copy locally.

```text
$ git clone git@github.com:username/project-template.git
$ cd node
$ git remote add upstream git://github.com/kuetemeier/project-template.git
```

#### Which branch?

For developing new features and bug fixes, the `master` branch should be pulled
and built upon.

### Step 2: Branch

Create a feature branch and start hacking:

```text
$ git checkout -b my-feature-branch -t origin/master
```

### Step 3: Commit

Make sure git knows your name and email address:

```text
$ git config --global user.name "J. Random User"
$ git config --global user.email "j.random.user@example.com"
```

Writing good commit logs is important. This [blog article](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) is a good resource for learning how to write good commit messages. A commit log should describe what
changed and why. Follow these guidelines when writing one:

1. The first line should be 50 characters or less and contain a short
   description of the change prefixed with the name of the changed
   subsystem (e.g. "net: add localAddress and localPort to Socket").
2. Keep the second line blank.
3. Wrap all other lines at 72 columns.

A good commit log can look something like this:

```
subsystem: Explaining the commit in one line

Body of commit message is a few lines of text, explaining things
in more detail, possibly giving some background about the issue
being fixed, etc. etc.

The body of the commit message can be several paragraphs, and
please do proper word-wrap and keep columns shorter than about
72 characters or so. That way `git log` will show things
nicely even when it is indented.
```

The header line should be meaningful; it is what other people see when they
run `git shortlog` or `git log --oneline`.

Check the output of `git log --oneline files_that_you_changed` to find out
what subsystem (or subsystems) your changes touch.


### Step 4: Rebase

Use `git rebase` (not `git merge`) to sync your work from time to time.

```text
$ git fetch upstream
$ git rebase upstream/master
```


### Step 5: Test

Bug fixes and features **should come with tests**. Add your tests in the
`test` directory. Look at other tests to see how they should be
structured (license boilerplate, common includes, etc.).

```text
$ npm test
```

Make sure the linter is happy and that all tests pass. Please, do not submit
patches that fail either check.

### Step 6: Squash

Squash your commits into a single commit. 

```text
$ git rebase -i
```

Itâ€™s okay to force update your pull request.

### Step 7: CLA

If this is your first pull request and you haven't done so, [sign our CLA](https://cla-assistant.io/kuetemeier/project-template) with your GitHub account by following the link. You have to do this only once.

### Step 8: Push

```text
$ git push origin my-feature-branch
```

Go to https://github.com/yourusername/node and select your feature branch.
Click the 'Pull Request' button and fill out the form.

Pull requests are usually reviewed within a few days. If there are comments
to address, apply your changes in a separate commit and push that to your
feature branch. Post a comment in the pull request afterwards; GitHub does
not send out notifications when you add commits.

**Thanks for contributing and getting involved.**
